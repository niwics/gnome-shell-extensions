gnome-shell-extensions

======================

Extensions for Gnome Shell 3.4, forked from Linux Mint (MGSE - http://github.com/linuxmint/MGSE).

- Bottom Panel adds to the screen panel with DesktopSwitcher and WorkspaceSwitcher
- Window List adds to this panel "classical" buttons for switching windows


As Linux Mint started Cinnamon and extensions from Mint doesn't work in Gnome Shell 3.4, I forked and modified two of them for Gnome Shell 3.4.

INSTALLATION
1. Copy this two extensions to the directory /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions
2. Enable them (using GnomeTweakTool). Bottom Panel has to be enabled first.
3. Restart Gnome Shell (Alt+F2 and the command "r")
